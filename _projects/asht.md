I am currently reading on Adams spectral sequences and calculations using the same, under Prof Ramesh Kasilingam (IIT-M)
I read through part 3 of _Stable Homotopy and Generalized Homology_, J.F. Adams to understand the construction and convergence of Adams Spectral sequence.
I have summarized the contents of the first few chapters in this note. 
[Introduction to Stable Homotopy]({{ site.url }}/note.pdf) .
