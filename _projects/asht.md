I am currently studying about Adams spectral sequences and calculations using the same, under Prof Ramesh Kasilingam (IIT-M).

I read through part 3 of _Stable Homotopy and Generalized Homology_, J.F. Adams to understand the construction and convergence of Adams Spectral sequence.
I have summarized the contents of the first few chapters in this note: [Introduction to Stable Homotopy]({{ site.url }}/Shtnote.pdf){:target="_blank"}. (I will update the note soon to include sections on Adams specseq.)
