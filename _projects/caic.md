Most of the systems occurring in nature are chaotic i.e. changing initial conditions can lead to
vast changes in future. The "butterfly-effect": the notion that the flap of a butterfly's wing in Brazil can set off a series of atmospheric events that, weeks later, spurs the formation of a tornado in Texas, motivated us to study chaotic systems. 

As part of a project for my Introduction to Sage Math class, we used SageMath and employed a visual and programming heavy treatment to study chaotic systems.
