title: Stable Homotopy Theory
---

I am currently reading on Adams spectral sequences and calculations using the same, under Prof Ramesh Kasilingam (IIT-M)

I read through part 3 of _Stable Homotopy and Generalized Homology_, J.F. Adams to understand the construction and convergence of Adams Spectral sequence.

I have summarized the contents of the first few chapters in this note.
