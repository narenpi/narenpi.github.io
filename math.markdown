#### Stable Homotopy Theory
I am currently reading on Adams spectral sequences and calculations using the same, under Prof Ramesh Kasilingam (IIT-M)
I read through part 3 of _Stable Homotopy and Generalized Homology_, J.F. Adams to understand the construction and convergence of Adams Spectral sequence.
I have summarized the contents of the first few chapters in this note. 
[Introduction to Stable Homotopy]({{ site.url }}/note.pdf) .

#### Quadratic forms and Milnor K-theory
As part of my Master's thesis, I proved the base cases (n=0,1) of [Milnor's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_conjecture).
The report is available [here]({{ site.url }}/masthes.pdf) .

#### Attractors in Chaos
During my undergraduate Introduction to Sagemath class, as part of a group, I studied the chaotic behaviour of systems. The report can be accessed [here]({{ site.url}}/aic.pdf)
